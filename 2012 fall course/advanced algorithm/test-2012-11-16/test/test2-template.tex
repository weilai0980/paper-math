%%%% REPLACE Robert Endre Tarjan WITH YOUR COMPLETE NAME
%%%% NOTE: IF YOUR LAST NAME HAS ACCENTS, SOME LaTeX COMMANDS ARE:
%%%%       for diaeresis/umlaut ", as in German, use \"a, \"u, \"o, etc.
%%%%       for grave accent `, use \`e, \`a, \`u
%%%%       for acute accent ', use \'a, \'e, \'u
%%%%       for tilde ~, use \tilde{a}, \tilde{o}
%%%%       for caret ^, use \hat{e}, \hat{o}
%%%%	   if you need an accent on an i, say an umlaut, use \"\i{}
%%%%		the \i{} is an i without its dot; e.g., na\"\i{}ve
%%%%	   these all work well with lower-case letters,
%%%%	        but only so-so with upper-case letters

Recall that the subgraph $G'$ of $G$ induced by a subset $V'$ of $V$ is
the graph $G'=(V',E')$, where $E'$ is the subset of $E$ containing exactly
those edges with both endpoints in $V'$.
You are given an undirected graph $G=(V, E)$ (as an array of adjacency lists)
and a positive integer $K$
and asked to find a maximum subset of vertices such that the subgraph
of $G$ induced by these vertices has degree at least $K$ (i.e., every vertex
in the induced subgraph has degree of at least $K$).

Consider the following greedy algorithm:
\begin{quote}
  \sf
  repeatedly remove the remaining vertex of smallest (updated) degree,
  until all remaining vertices have degree at least $K$.
\end{quote}
We use a priority queue to retrieve the remaining vertex of smallest degree;
since removing a vertex decreases the degree of its neighbors, we use a
Fibonacci heap to take advantage of its efficient \texttt{DecreaseKey}
operation.  Thus our algorithm begins by building a Fibonacci heap containing
all vertices, using the degree of each vertex as the priority key.
Our main loop then simply runs a \texttt{DeleteMin} operation on the heap.
If the heap is empty, the algorithm stops and returns the empty set;
otherwise, it tests the key (degree) of the returned vertex $v$ against $K$.
If the degree is at least $K$, the algorithm stops and returns the collection
of vertices still in the heap.  Otherwise, the algorithm updates the degrees
of the neighbors of $v$ (listed in the adjacency list of $v$) using
\texttt{DecreaseKey} and begins the next iteration.

Prove the correctness of this algorithm and that it runs in
$O(|E|+|V|\cdot\log(|V|))$ worst-case time.

\bigskip\noindent
You are given an undirected network $N=(V, E)$ with integral edge capacities,
a source, $s$, and a sink, $t$.
Define $N$ to be \emph{$k$-stable} if and only if the value of the maximum
$s$-$t$ flow does not increase under any $k$-edge alteration.  A $k$-edge
alteration consists of picking $k$ edges of the network and assigning them
arbitrary new (positive integral) capacities.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
    Design an algorithm to test whether $N$ is $1$-stable; your
    algorithm should run in $O(|V|^2 \cdot |E|)$ time.
  \item
    Design an algorithm to test whether $N$ is $2$-stable; your
    algorithm should also run in $O(|V|^2 \cdot |E|)$ time,
    although it is likely to involve significantly more work.
